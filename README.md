#### *Stock Debian ARM64 Linux for the NanoPi R5C & R5S*

This stock Debian ARM64 Linux image is built directly from official packages using the Debian [Debootstrap](https://wiki.debian.org/Debootstrap) utility, see file `steps/install_rootfs_1st_stage.sh`.

Being an unmodified Debian build, patches are directly available from the Debian repos using the stock **apt** package manager, see function `file_apt_sources()` in file `steps/finalize_rootfs.sh`.

If you want to run true up-stream Debian Linux on your ARM64 device, this is the way to do it.

### debian bookworm setup

<br/>

**1. download the appropriate image**
```
(R5C) wget https://github.com/inindev/nanopi-r5/releases/download/v12.0.3/nanopi-r5c_bookworm-1203.img.xz
(R5S) wget https://github.com/inindev/nanopi-r5/releases/download/v12.0.3/nanopi-r5s_bookworm-1203.img.xz
```

<br/>

**2. determine the location of the target micro sd card**

 * before plugging-in device
```
ls -l /dev/sd*
ls: cannot access '/dev/sd*': No such file or directory
```

 * after plugging-in device
```
ls -l /dev/sd*
brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8, 0 Mar 19 21:08 /dev/sda
```
* note: for mac, the device is ```/dev/rdiskX```

<br/>

**3. in the case above, substitute 'a' for 'X' in the command below (for /dev/sda)**
```
sudo sh -c 'xzcat nanopi-r5s_bookworm-1203.img.xz > /dev/sdX && sync'
```

#### when the micro sd has finished imaging, eject and use it to boot the nanopi r5c or r5s to finish setup

<br/>

**4. login account**
```
user: debian
pass: debian
```

<br/>

**5. take updates**
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```

<br/>

**6. create new admin account**
```
sudo adduser <youruserid>
echo '<youruserid> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL' | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/<youruserid>
sudo chmod 440 /etc/sudoers.d/<youruserid>
```

<br/>

**7. lockout and/or delete debian account**
```
sudo passwd -l debian
sudo chsh -s /usr/sbin/nologin debian
```

```
sudo deluser --remove-home debian
sudo rm /etc/sudoers.d/debian
```

<br/>

**8. change hostname (optional)**
```
sudo nano /etc/hostname
sudo nano /etc/hosts
```

### booting from internal eMMC

<br/>

Imaging the internal eMMC device involves booting from a removable MMC card and imaging the internal eMMC device. When booted, the removable MMC device is seen as ```/dev/mmcblk0``` and the internal eMMC device is seen as ```/dev/mmcblk1```

<br/>

**1. boot from removable MMC**

Using the steps in the first section above, create a removable MMC card and boot using it. Note: If the internal eMMC device already has a bootable image on it, it will prefer to boot from that. To force the nanopi5 to boot from the removable MMC card you just made, hold the ```mask``` button down before applying power. Once successfully booted to the removable MMC, you will be able to see this by using the ```df``` command which will show /dev/mmcblk0p1 as the booted partition.

<br/>

**2. download the appropriate image to the booted MMC card and image the internal eMMC**
```
(R5C) wget https://github.com/inindev/nanopi-r5/releases/download/v12.0.3/nanopi-r5c_bookworm-1203.img.xz
(R5S) wget https://github.com/inindev/nanopi-r5/releases/download/v12.0.3/nanopi-r5s_bookworm-1203.img.xz
sudo su
xzcat nanopi-r5s_bookworm-1203.img.xz > /dev/mmcblk1
```

<br/>

Once imaging completes, shutdown, remove the MMC card and it will then boot using the internal eMMC device.

Note: Once booted, ```sudo apt update``` then ```sudo apt upgrade``` to get the latest updates from the debian repositories.

<br/>

### booting from internal NVMe _(r5s only)_

<br/>

Imaging the internal NVMe device involves booting from a removable MMC card and imaging the internal NVMe device. When booted, the internal NVMe device is seen as ```/dev/nvme0n1```

<br/>

**1. boot from removable MMC**

Using the steps in the first section above, create a removable MMC card and boot using it. Note: If the internal eMMC device already has a bootable image on it, it will prefer to boot from that. To force the nanopi5 to boot from the removable MMC card you just made, hold the ```mask``` button down before applying power. Once successfully booted to the removable MMC, you will be able to see this by using the ```df``` command which will show /dev/mmcblk0p1 as the booted partition.

<br/>

**2. download the image to the booted MMC card and image the internal NVMe**
```
wget https://github.com/inindev/nanopi-r5/releases/download/v12.0.3/nanopi-r5s_bookworm-1203.img.xz
sudo su
xzcat nanopi-r5s_bookworm-1203.img.xz > /dev/nvme0n1
```

<br/>

**3. install u-boot to internal eMMC**

The last step is to prepare the internal eMMC to host u-boot. The eMMC must not contain a bootable partition or it will be preferred for boot over the internal NVMe. Start by downloading the two u-boot files:
```
wget https://github.com/inindev/nanopi-r5/releases/download/v12.0.3/idbloader-r5s.img
wget https://github.com/inindev/nanopi-r5/releases/download/v12.0.3/u-boot-r5s.itb
```

Erase the internal eMMC (the device is actually ```/dev/mmcblk1``` but X is placed where 1 belongs to prevent a copy paste mistake)
```
sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/mmcblkX bs=1M count=1024
```

The internal eMMC is now erased, install u-boot (again, change X to 1):
```
sudo dd bs=4K seek=8 if=idbloader-r5s.img of=/dev/mmcblkX
sudo dd bs=4K seek=2048 if=u-boot-r5s.itb of=/dev/mmcblkX
```

**4. setup is now complete and the system is ready for use**

shutdown the device, remove the external mmc card, and restart the device

Note: Once booted, ```sudo apt update``` then ```sudo apt upgrade``` to get the latest updates from the debian repositories.

### building debian bookworm arm64 for the nanopi r5c / r5s from scratch

<br/>

The build script uses docker and qemu to build an image compatible with arm64 devices,
even if you run it on a standard x86 machine.

<br/>

**1. clone the repo**
```
git clone https://github.com/inindev/nanopi-r5.git
cd nanopi-r5
```

<br/>

**2. run the debian build script**
```
(R5C) cd debian/nanopi-r5c
(R5S) cd debian/nanopi-r5s
sudo sh make_debian_img.sh
```
* note: edit the script at `debian/env.sh` to change various options: ```nano ../env.sh```

<br/>

**3. the output if the build completes successfully**
```
mmc_2g.img.xz
```

<br/>
